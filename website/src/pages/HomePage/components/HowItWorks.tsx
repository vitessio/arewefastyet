        Seven workloads are executed against every commit we decide to
        benchmark. These workloads define the SQL schema, the queries we
        execute, the configuration of the Vitess cluster, and the configuration
        of sysbench. The settings of our workload can be found on the

        Generally, we benchmark the main and release branches of Vitess every
        night at midnight UTC. We also detect new PRs that need to be
        benchmarked every five minutes, and new tags/releases every minute.{" "}

        Each commit is benchmarked ten times by each workload. Under the hood,
        we use sysbench with a custom configuration to perform the benchmark. We
        then perform statistical analysis on the ten results of a given workload
        to get a more accurate and reliable result.

        Every execution is done on the same hardware: 192Gb of RAM and 2xÂ Intel
        Xeon Silver 4214 Processor 24-Core @ 2.20GHz.{" "}

        We collect the same results as sysbench (QPS, TPS, Error rate, latency,
        etc), along with several Golang metrics such as the CPU used per query,
        and the total memory used per query.{" "}
